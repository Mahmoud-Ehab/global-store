GlobalStore is a free open-source software application. Itâ€™s intended to be a self-organized store application, where any one on the web can publish his or her service or product. The application is self-organized in the sense that the community or the users (vendors & customers) are playing a big role in the administration. 

Any registered user can publish, review, and report products/services. However, reports weights vary according to users credibility. If a user with a credibility equals to 1 has reported a product service, review, or even an account, the reported item would have an 1 RW (report weight) increment in its total reports weight value. When the total reports weight for any item exceeds a certain limit (that the community specify every two weeks), the item (the account) will be removed (banned).

In default, all users have 1 CR (credibility). For each successful product/service the account CR increments by one. A product/service is considered successful if it has more than ten positive reviews (also, that metric is specified by the community every two weeks).
